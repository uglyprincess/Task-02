First and foremost, I am interested in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Wing of Geekhaven. 
I don't have any specific reasons for this inclination. 
I haven't had much experience with coding in the past and this seemed like a good place to start.
I expect to learn more about programming and open source softwares.

Secondly, I am interested in Web Development, since I had to pick either WebD or AppD, and the former was more appealing.
I just don't like looking at small screens. I know this is a ridiculous reason to pick WebD over AppD, but to the uninitiated like me, it was as good as any.
I expect this Wing to give me an insight into how websites are made from the backend as well as the frontend.
This is a valuable tool which is bound to help me in the future. 

I am also interested in Cyber Security. 
I have always been fascinated by ciphers, coded messages and such, thanks to an unhealthy helping of spy movies. 
Apart from this, it appeals to me because at its core, it is pure problem solving, sort of like math. And I like math.
I expect to learn more about different sorts of extensions and softwares and cryptography techniques. 

And then there's CC.
You can't not join CC.
